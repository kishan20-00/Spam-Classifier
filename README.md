   1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
   2. Natural Engineering
   3. Data Cleaning
   4. Vectorization
   5. Modelling
   
In here, Data cleaning some processes such as:
   1. Clearing punctuation
   2. Tokenization
   3. Lemmatization & Stemming
 
Also, In Modelling there are some methods and models:
